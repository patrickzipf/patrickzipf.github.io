*(Verse 1)*
In the heart of winter’s glow,
There’s a tale that’s new but feels so old,
Zipfsmas comes with lights so bold,
In hues that Patrick Zipf foretold.

*(Chorus)*
Oh, Zipfsmas, oh Zipfsmas,
With your trees so geometrically bright,
Oh, Zipfsmas, oh Zipfsmas,
You turn our darkest night into light.

*(Verse 2)*
Abstract stars and vibrant scenes,
Adorn the streets in festive dreams,
Art and joy blend in streams,
Zipfsmas magic, or so it seems.

*(Chorus)*
Oh, Zipfsmas, oh Zipfsmas,
You’re a canvas painted with cheer,
Oh, Zipfsmas, oh Zipfsmas,
Your beauty draws everyone near.

*(Bridge)*
In the heart of every art,
Lies a spark that Zipfsmas imparts,
Creativity in all our hearts,
Bringing together, not apart.

*(Verse 3)*
Gifts wrapped in artistic flair,
Love and joy, we all share,
Zipfsmas feast, a culinary affair,
In this celebration, none compare.

*(Chorus)*
Oh, Zipfsmas, oh Zipfsmas,
Your spirit, a dance of color and light,
Oh, Zipfsmas, oh Zipfsmas,
In your splendor, we all unite.

*(Outro)*
As Zipfsmas night fades away,
Its spirit in our hearts will stay,
A blend of art, in a merry array,
Until next year, on this festive day.
